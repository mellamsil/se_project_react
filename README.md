# WTWR (What to Wear?)

The WTWR (What to Wear) project provides a simple and intuitive way for its users to plan their outfits based on the weather. The project leverages a range of front-end, API integration, design, and development techniques to create a dynamic and user-friendly application.

## Project Description

The WTWR (What to Wear) project is a full-stack web application that recommends suitable clothing to users based on the current weather. The application uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data and provides users with a curated selection of clothing items that are suitable for the current weather conditions. This repository contains the front-end implementation of the application, built using React.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Source code for the application
- `components/`: React components
- `utils/`: Utility functions and constants
- `vendor/`: Third-party libraries and fonts

## Project Functionality

- Weather Data Fetching: The application fetches current weather data from the OpenWeather API, including temperature, location, and weather conditions.

- Clothing Recommendations: Based on the weather data, the application recommends suitable clothing items to users. The clothing items are stored in a hard-coded array of data and are filtered based on the current weather conditions.

- Clothing Card Display: The application displays a set of clothing cards, each representing a clothing item. The cards include images and titles of the clothing items.

- Modal Functionality: Users can open and close a modal window to view more information about a clothing item. When a user clicks on a clothing card, the modal window opens, displaying the image and title of the clothing item.

- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it looks great on different screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
- Vite
- OpenWeather API

## Description of techniques used

### Front-end Techniques:

- React: The project uses React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows the creation of reusable UI components and efficient rendering of dynamic content.
- Components: The project is structured around React components, which are used to represent different parts of the application, such as clothing cards, modals, and headers.
- State Management: The project uses React state management to store and manage application data, such as weather data and clothing items.
- Props: The project uses React props to pass data and functions between components, enabling communication and data sharing between different parts of the application.
- Event Handling: The project uses event handling techniques, such as click events and API calls, to respond to user interactions and fetch data.

### API Integration:

- OpenWeather API: The project integrates with the OpenWeather API to fetch current weather data, including temperature, location, and weather conditions.
- API Calls: The project uses API calls to fetch data from the OpenWeather API and update the application state accordingly.

### Design Techniques:

- Responsive Design: The project uses responsive design techniques to ensure that the application looks great on different screen sizes and devices.
- CSS: The project uses CSS to style and layout the application, including the use of media queries to adapt to different screen sizes.

### Development Techniques:

- Vite: The project uses Vite, a modern development server and build tool, to streamline the development process and optimize the application for production.
- Prettier: The project uses Prettier, a code formatter, to maintain consistent code formatting and improve code readability.
